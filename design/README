4x4 matmul design here is handcoded. The design include convolution support as well as accumulators.
The design is monolithic that is the accumulator, data setup etc is all in one module.
It doesn't support composition to make larger matmuls though.

8x8 matmul design here was generated from the create_mat_mul.py script.
It has convolution support as well as accumulators. 
The command used was: create_mat_mul.py -s 8 -f 8x8_gen.v
The design doesn't support composition to make larger matmuls.
This was the design we tested in the TPU. All tests in the repo will work with this design.

16x16 matmul design here was generated from create_mat_mul.py script.
It has not been tested in the TPU design.
